# CodeFuse Project - React Native Mobile Development

Welcome to the CodeFuse project! This repository is used for mobile React Native development, inspired by platforms like [bolt.new](https://bolt.new). This README will guide you through the steps to get started, including setting up the environment, building the Docker image, installing dependencies, and running services.

## Table of Contents

1. [Clone the Repository](#clone-the-repository)
2. [Build the Docker Image](#build-the-docker-image)
3. [Install Bun](#install-bun)
4. [Initialize PostgreSQL](#initialize-postgresql)
5. [Initialize .env](#initialize-env)
6. [Running the Application](#running-the-application)

## 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine. Use the following command to clone the repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/codefuse.git
cd codefuse
```

### Folder Structure

Upon cloning the repository, you will see the following folder structure:

```
hkirat/
    hkirat/
    Prod/
    ae8620c/
    .github/
        workflows/
    expo-base-app/
    ext/
    localhost/
    framework-serializer/
    mobile-magic/
    nextjs-base-app/
    ops/
    react-base-app/
    .gitignore
```

## 2. Build the Docker Image

In order to build the Docker image for the project, navigate to the `docker` folder and build the Docker image using the following command:

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile.code-server -t code-server-update .
```

This will create a Docker image named `code-server-update`.

## 3. Run the Docker Image

Once the Docker image is built, you can run the Docker container with the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 code-server-update
```

This will start the application on port 8080. You can access the application by opening your browser and navigating to `http://localhost:8080`.

## 4. Install Bun

[Bun](https://bun.sh/) is a fast JavaScript runtime, and it's required for this project. 

### For Linux Users (Arch-based)

For Arch-based Linux systems, you can install Bun using `yay`. First, install `yay` if you haven't already:

```bash
sudo pacman -S yay
```

Then, install Bun:

```bash
yay -S bun
```

### For macOS or Windows

For macOS and Windows users, download and install Bun from the official website: [https://bun.sh](https://bun.sh).

Once Bun is installed, proceed to the next step.

## 5. Initialize PostgreSQL

We are using PostgreSQL as the database for the application. To initialize PostgreSQL, use the following Docker command:

```bash
docker run -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mypassword -p 5432:5432 postgres
```

This will run PostgreSQL inside a Docker container with the password `mypassword`. 

### Run PostgreSQL in Detached Mode

If you want to run PostgreSQL in the background (detached mode), use the following command:

```bash
docker run -d -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mypassword -p 5432:5432 postgres
```

This will run PostgreSQL in the background, and you can interact with it via port 5432.

## 6. Initialize .env

Before starting the application, ensure you have the `.env` file configured correctly. You can use the `.env.example` file as a template for creating your `.env` file. To do this, simply copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then, open `.env` and adjust any environment variables as needed for your setup.

## 7. Running the Application

Once the environment is set up, and PostgreSQL is running, you can start the application. 

Make sure all the necessary dependencies are installed by running:

```bash
bun install
```

Sure! Hereâ€™s the continuation of your `README.md` file, including the new steps you mentioned:


## 8. Migrate Prisma Database

To migrate the Prisma database, navigate to the `packages/db` folder and run the following command:

```bash
cd packages/db
npx prisma migrate dev
```

This will apply the migrations to the PostgreSQL database and sync it with the schema defined in your Prisma setup.

## 9. Start the Frontend

To start the frontend application, go to the `apps/frontend` directory and run the following command to start the development server using Bun:

```bash
cd apps/frontend
bun dev
```

This will start the frontend application and make it available for local development.

## 10. Start the Backend

To start the backend server, navigate to the `apps/primary-backend` directory and run the following command to start the backend:

```bash
cd apps/primary-backend
bun index.ts
```

This will start the backend server, and it should now be running and ready to handle requests.

## 11. Add API Keys to .env

Make sure to configure all necessary API keys in your `.env` file. You can reference the `.env.example` file to see which keys need to be added.

To copy the example `.env` file to your actual `.env` file, use the following command:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then, open the `.env` file and add all the required API keys and environment-specific variables.

## 12. Start the LLM Backend

Finally, to start the LLM (Large Language Model) backend, go to the `apps/worker` directory and run the following command:

```bash
cd apps/worker
bun dev
```

Here is the continuation of the README with the steps to sign in to Clerk, update the JWT key, and set the Clerk-related environment variables (`NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`) as per the `.env.example` file:

## 13. Sign In to Clerk

Clerk is used for authentication and managing user sessions in the application. To integrate Clerk into your project, you'll need to sign in to Clerk and configure the required keys.

### Sign Up / Sign In to Clerk

1. Go to the [Clerk dashboard](https://clerk.dev) and sign up for an account or log in if you already have one.
2. Once logged in, go to the **API Keys** section in the Clerk dashboard.
3. Obtain the following keys:
    - **Publishable Key** (`NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`)
    - **Secret Key** (`CLERK_SECRET_KEY`)

### Update `.env` with Clerk Keys

After obtaining the Clerk keys, you'll need to update your `.env` file with the values for `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`.

1. Copy the keys from your Clerk dashboard.
2. Open the `.env` file in the root of your project.
3. Update the environment variables with the following:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your-clerk-publishable-key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your-clerk-secret-key
```

Make sure to replace `your-clerk-publishable-key` and `your-clerk-secret-key` with the actual keys from Clerk.

### Update JWT Key

You may also need to update the JWT key in your `.env` file, depending on your Clerk configuration. For example:

```bash
JWT_KEY=your-jwt-secret-key
```

Ensure that all keys are correctly updated and saved.

## 14. Restart the Application

After updating the environment variables, restart all services (frontend, backend, and worker) to apply the changes.

1. Restart the frontend:

    ```bash
    cd apps/frontend
    bun dev
    ```

2. Restart the backend:

    ```bash
    cd apps/primary-backend
    bun index.ts
    ```

3. Restart the LLM worker:

    ```bash
    cd apps/worker
    bun dev
    ```
